Semiparametric model development for the conditional covariance matrix that is flexible and remains easy to estimate in high dimensional systems. The model is semiparametric in that it integrates parametric univariate Generalized Auto Regressive Conditional Heteroskedasticity specifications for the conditional volatilities with nonparametric machine learning estimators nearest neighbor and random forest for the conditional correlations.

For implementation of the nearest neighbor and random forest algorithms, we make use of a widely-used machine learning library for the Python programming language: Scikit-learn \citep{ref:Pedregosa2011}.
